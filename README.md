# Bloch Sam

Inspired from Sam Ved which enlists the symphony of music with handful of Raags. So, the Bloch Sphere controlling the entire quantum computing theology can be controlled with the help of handful of Gates. Bloch Sam is the live simulation of the effect of a Quantum Gate on Bloch Sphere and the genesis of several concepts like superposition etc.
